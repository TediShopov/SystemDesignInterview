# Toot The Lute

### Legend
**Crochet** - Seconds per beat: Crochet = 60 / BPM. Used to convert beat lengths into seconds.

**Beat** - Data describing a musical event; includes a Length (in beats). Real-time length is Length * Crochet.

**Reference Target** - The Transform at which the player is expected to hit the beat (the timing "hit line").

**Input Offset** - Calibration shift applied to align player input with audio timing.

**Visual Offset** - Calibration shift applied to align visuals with audio timing.

# Rollback Netcode Fighting Game

## Rollback System

Here's how the buffers are arranged and used for the live fighters and their rollback shadows:
* **Live fighter buffers:** Each fighter instance has a FighterBufferMono that creates and owns an InputBuffer in Awake(), copies its inspector settings (delay, pressed-keys history), and assigns it to FighterController.InputBuffer.

The local fighter sets CollectInputFromKeyboard = true, so FighterBufferMono.FixedUpdate() captures the keyboard each fixed tick and enqueues a stamped InputFrame (now + DelayInput).

The remote fighter's buffer is filled by the net layer with received InputFrames (same format: stamp, checksum, inputs).

* **Rollback shadow buffers:** Each fighter has a paired RB (rollback) clone that also holds an InputBuffer (e.g., PlayerRBBuffer, EnemyRBBuffer). After the live fighter enqueues/consumes for the current tick, that same frame is appended to the shadow buffer, keeping a trailing window of DelayInput + rollbackWindow frames. When late inputs arrive for a past stamp, the shadow buffer uses RollbackEnqueue to replace the predicted frame at that stamp and re-predict any following frames so its timeline stays consistent.

* **How they work together during a rollback**  When a late frame requires rewinding, Restore.Rollback(...):
1. Swaps live fighters with their RB clones (the "rollback shadow" = the saved gameplay state).

2. Builds a temporary rollback buffer per side by concatenating the shadow's buffer with the live buffer's recent frames (BufferToRollbackWith(RBBuffer, liveBuffer)), ensuring the full timeline from the rollback point to "now".

3. Feeds that buffer to FighterController.Resimulate(...) to replay inputs up to the present, then hands control back to the live objects.

In short: the live buffer is the real-time input queue used to step gameplay each tick; the rollback shadow buffer is the curated, replaceable history that pairs with the shadowâ€™s saved state so the engine can rewind, apply authoritative inputs, and deterministically catch back up.

* Clock synchronization to align start times.
* Deterministic gameplay using FixedMath.NET (fixed-point) with uncapped rendering.
* Lightweight lobbies and in-app chat.
* Checksum-based desync detection.

[InputBuffer.cs](RollbackNetcode/Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Input%20Buffers/InputBuffer.cs)
* Defines InputFrame (byte-packed inputs, frame stamp, checksum, predicted flag).
* InputBuffer queue: delay, prediction, rollback replacement, pressed-keys history.

[FighterBufferMono.cs](RollbackNetcode/Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Input%20Buffers/FighterBufferMono.cs)
* Mono bridge that captures local keyboard input each fixed frame.
* Enqueues into InputBuffer with configured delay and raises an event for observers.

[Restore.cs](RollbackNetcode/Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Core/Restore.cs)
* Resimulates N frames starting from the "Rollback Shadow's" state (A copy of the player character N frame in the past. Meant to be invisible in production)
* Additionally, initializes/destroys projectiles as necessary to match the correct game state.

[FighterController.cs](RollbackNetcode/Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Fighter/FighterController.cs)
* Deterministic fighter logic (FixedMath.NET): movement, jump, facing, block/crouch.
* Consumes stamped InputFrames (or predicted) and updates animator/render state.


# Destructible Terrain - DX11 Computer Graphics Project 

This system takes a heightfield terrain, raycasts to find an impact point, extracts a peak patch around that hit, cuts it against a plane to create a closed solid, 
shatters the solid into chunks with multiple procedural plane cuts, and then spawns Bullet rigid bodies that blast outward. (Inside and outside mesh surfaces use different shaders).
The rendering side uses a CPU-writable "destroyed mask" texture that's copied to an SRV; terrain generation samples this mask so subsequent rebuilds reflect the missing destroyed region.

parameters for a shader
